        <h2>Lasagna Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Meat:</li>
            <p>This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</p>
            
            <li>Onion and garlic:</li>
            <p>An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</p>

            <li>Tomato products</li>
            <p>You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</p>

            <li>Sugar</li>
            <p>Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</p>

            <li>Spices and Seasoning:</li>
            <p>This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</p>

            <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
            <p>Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</p>

            <li>Cheeses</li>
            <p>Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</p>

            <li>Egg</li>
            <p>An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</p>
        </ul>
