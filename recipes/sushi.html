    <h1>Sushi Recipe</h1>
    <p>First thing first, the word sushi (寿司, 鮨) actually means “sour rice” in Japanese. To make great sushi, you need
        to start with the rice. We first cook Japanese short-grain rice and then season it with sweetened vinegar. Once
        the rice cools just slightly, we’ll shape it to make sushi.</p>

    <h2>Sushi Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Sushi Rice: You’ll need Japanese short-grain rice, rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. I often add kombu
                (kelp) for additional fragrance, but it is optional.</li>
            <li>Nori(Seaweed): We’ll use roasted sheets of nori seaweed (nori sheet). For the best quality nori, look
                for the most expensive one available at your local Asian grocery stores or online. I get mine (imported
                from Japan) from my local Japanese store.</li>
            <li>Ingredients – In Japan, seafood (raw or fresh) is the primary ingredient used in sushi. Popular choices
                are salmon, tuna, shrimp, octopus, etc. Veggies such as carrots, cucumber, daikon radish, shiso leaves,
                etc. are also included in certain types of sushi. Depending on the sushi, you can certainly work with
                whatever ingredients you prefer.</li>
            <li>Sushi Accompaniments – We often serve soy sauce, wasabi, and gari (pickled ginger) alongside the sushi.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How To Make Sushi Step-By-Step:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare sushi rice by mixing cooked short-grain rice with seasoned vinegar. Check out this article to find step-by-step instructions on how to make sushi rice.</li>
            <li>Cut both ends of the cucumber and peel it. Now cut it in half lengthwise and repeat to get 4 strips. Remove the seeds and cut again to get 8 pieces in total.</li>
            <li>Cut out thin slices of raw tuna, about ¼- ½ inches thick. Make long stripes.</li>
            <li>Place the bamboo mat (click to see my favorite sushi making kits) on a flat surface and cover it with a plastic sheet. Now put the Nori sheet on the bamboo mat. Remember that the rough side4of the Nori should face towards you.</li>
            <li>Moisten your hands. Take a medium ball of sushi rice in your hands and spread an even layer on the Nori. Use your fingers to apply gentle pressure and keep a half-inch space on all sides</li>
            <li>Now add cucumber and tuna strips in the middle section of the rice. If the tuna or cucumber pieces are short, you may add extra pieces lined up to cover the Nori sheet’s length.</li>
            <li>Roll the bamboo mat away from you to create a tight and compact log. Keep pressing slightly as you roll to ensure that the ingredients stick together properly. Apply a few drops of water on the edges and seal it.</li>
            <li>Moisten the knife and cut the roll into 6-8 pieces. Serve with soya sauce and wasabi. Repeat the steps for the remaining ingredients.</li>
        </ol>
