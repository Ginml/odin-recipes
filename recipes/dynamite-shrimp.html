    <h2>Dynamite Shrimp Ingredients:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Shrimp: I used large shrimp that had already been peeled and deveined for easy prep.</li>

            <li>All-Purpose Flour: Flour is the essential ingredient for creating a light and crispy tempura batter that coats the shrimp, giving it the perfect crunch.</li>

            <li>Cornstrach: Working alongside the flour, cornstarch contributes to the shrimp’s crispy coating, adding an extra layer of crunchiness.</li>

            <li>Cold Water: The cold water in the batter works its magic, creating a light and airy texture.</li>
            
            <li>Club Soda: Club soda is the bubbly addition that adds fizziness to the batter. It makes it even lighter and ensures the shrimp turn out nice and crispy.</li>

            <li>Egg: The egg binds all the ingredients together, providing structure to the batter and helping it stick to the shrimp.</li>

            <li>Vegetable Oil: Used for frying the shrimp to golden perfection.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How To Make Dynamite Shrimp Step-By-Step:</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat Oil: Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over high heat. A deep fryer can also be used.</li>

            <li>Devein: Remove the shell and devein the shrimp while leaving the tails on. Then pat the shrimp dry with paper towels.</li>

            <li>Flour Mixture: Sift together the flour and cornstarch in a medium bowl and then set aside.</li>

            <li>Mix Wet Ingredients: In another bowl, whisk together the cold water, cold club soda, and 1 egg.</li>

            <li>Combine: Then add the liquid mixture to the flour mixture. Stir with a fork and just until combined. It’s ok if the shrimp batter is lumpy.</li>

            <li>Coat and Fry: Quickly working while the batter is still chilled, dip the shrimp into the batter then place in the pot of oil. Cook each shrimp tempura until golden in color.</li>

            <li>Cool: Remove from hot skillet and transfer to a plate lined with paper towels.</li>

            <li>Repeat: Repeat the steps until all the shrimp is cooked.</li>
        </ol>
